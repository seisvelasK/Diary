# Onboarding Morn

Today I began! The people seem great, and frankly I'm more anxious re my social performance than my technical prowess. Which is good - I want to optimize where it matters. I'm still not-yet-invited to our Github org, nor even have I entered SalesForce. And I haven't really heard much about the project. But boy, have there been problems aplenty.

Linux refuses to install (luckily [in a way]) my neighbor is cursed with the same difficulty. I can't enter Github (my normal GH that is) nor any of my gmail accounts. Fati not lending me the phone really did quite a number on me. No need to whine though; in reality, I've no absolute use for any of those yet. And in fact I made a new GH so fuck it. If I need it today, I've got seisvelasK[square] (haha, aren't I lovely). Hopefully Erick (the other new person, the one with even greater Linux troubles than I, will become an easy friend vis-a-vis our mutual struggle for software freedom). Time will tell, but so will performance. My performance. So, enough writing.

Time to perform. 

# Linux!

Holy Camoly! New neighbor came through and managed to get Linux working! There used to be a whole other paragraph here but I forgot to commit before restarting to try his Ubuntu install hack. Still uninvited to Slack, Github, and unlogged into SalesForce. But at least I'm getting started. I should think about how to manage my social media habits while at work. I don't need to be reading Red Pill literature all day (although a little could be nice - I think it's a male corrollary to feminspo crap ala DAMN or Cosmo). 

This paragraph originally discussed all the React stuff I'm studying while I basically sit on my butt waiting. So that stuff is all still true - I'm reading React stuff and kind of just learned `useReducer`, which was surprisingly simple compared to my battle with `useContext` and `useRef`, both of which continue to baffle me.

# AppSec

As alluded to prior, I'm in some ways coalescing into AppSec. That's wierd to be since, given my background, I'd expect to be better at 'regular old' system hacking - the kind where I have a user on a shell and want more. So, privilege escalation in a Unix shell. I definitely don't plan to let those skills fester (Hello, online CTF's), but AppSec has always been my calling, if you think about it. I got into this because I wanted to hack websites, period. That's what I'm going to learn. So here's the seeds of what will (I hope) spring into beautiful studies:

* OWASP
* OverTheWire
* Security StackExchange (actually ANSWER questions!)
* Sam from work
* Projects with Franco
* Do an indepth study of the security of apps in worlds that interest me, like Tor Hidden Services and Racket webapps.  These can be Epiphany posts which will get me luvv.
* All those hackerzzz 90's looking sites on Tor and clearnet with lots of tools. Jacob can maybe be helpful.
* Look into online CTF's :). 

Naturally I'll be narrowing these down as I focus and find what has the greatest payoff. What really matters to me is to not become too much of a gamer. I don't want to be a CTF wargame master who can't actually touch anything running in production. That said, I very well could make a todo list of CTF's and wargames to hack and blog each one. Every three wargames I do a real hack as well. Idk. Something like that. The problem is I know nothing: I need to spend lots of times on games and playing with vulns and learning base skills. Setting up my lab and making friends (potentially hardest part). Paying for that MentorCruise guy could be of real value here.

In the meantime I *really* need to go learn Redux. The great thing is that my webdev time is not fully wasted towards my appsec dream. Afterall, I'll be mostly reviewing web dev code as an appsec prof. 

# ~~Google~~ Ksquare Hire

I'm on my first project!! It's internal, as should be expected (and frankly I'm grateful for), and it'll be all trainees. So I shouldn't embarrass myself too much. The database sounds like the only real architectural challenge. On backend, there are some authentication and access roles questions that remain unanswered, but everything else oughtta be dead simple. What I do expect to struggle with is the unnecessarily deep frontend stack. Time to learn Redux! And like nine other things I'd never heard of!

# Day's End

I'm home now with my fancy Ubuntu work laptop. Thoughts run through my head. I need to buy an electric buzzer for my beard, soap, foodstuffs of great variety, cook ramen (like now, I'm starving), learn l33t h4cks, but also learn the massive world of web dev to a professional degree, meet up with what's-his-name and Franco tomorrow, do great on my project, get a motorcycle, write a blog post on how Torsocks works. Oh my. I've been trying to find a good todo list system for so long. Tonight, I'm going to end this post with the todolist that's been running through my head in spurts, randomly, all bits-and-pieces today:

* Buy a motorcycle
* Learn hiring app tech stack
* Beat [http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/](natas)
* New apt near new office
* GH and Gmail account recovery
* Security StackExchange
* CSRF wtf? Code example may help.
* Make ramen
* Pay rent (I need landlord's #)
* Buy electric shaver
* Learn saxophone (haha)
* Gym membership (SmartFit vs something else?)
* BJJ
* Talk to Scottish Hacker Sam
* Post enramenadas & Linux area to Reddit (mention that CDMX metro system all runs Fedora as well as metrobus)

I don't write this in anxiety over the mountain of crap I need to do. Most of it is quick, one time things I can plough through the second I have the cash. Or the moment arrives. The app thing will happen either way, it's my job (for example). The apt and moto are just a matter of saving. Pay rent will happen on rent day when I call the landlord. Landlords like money, afterall.
