# Onboarding Morn

----

Today I began! The people seem great, and frankly I'm more anxious re my social performance than my technical prowess. Which is good - I want to optimize where it matters. I'm still not-yet-invited to our Github org, nor even have I entered SalesForce. And I haven't really heard much about the project. But boy, have there been problems aplenty.

Linux refuses to install (luckily [in a way]) my neighbor is cursed with the same difficulty. I can't enter Github (my normal GH that is) nor any of my gmail accounts. Fati not lending me the phone really did quite a number on me. No need to whine though; in reality, I've no absolute use for any of those yet. And in fact I made a new GH so fuck it. If I need it today, I've got seisvelasK[square] (haha, aren't I lovely). Hopefully Erick (the other new person, the one with even greater Linux troubles than I, will become an easy friend vis-a-vis our mutual struggle for software freedom). Time will tell, but so will performance. My performance. So, enough writing.

Time to perform. 

# Linux!

Holy Camoly! New neighbor came through and managed to get Linux working! There used to be a whole other paragraph here but I forgot to commit before restarting to try his Ubuntu install hack. Still uninvited to Slack, Github, and unlogged into SalesForce. But at least I'm getting started. I should think about how to manage my social media habits while at work. I don't need to be reading Red Pill literature all day (although a little could be nice - I think it's a male corrollary to feminspo crap ala DAMN or Cosmo). 

This paragraph originally discussed all the React stuff I'm studying while I basically sit on my butt waiting. So that stuff is all still true - I'm reading React stuff and kind of just learned `useReducer`, which was surprisingly simple compared to my battle with `useContext` and `useRef`, both of which continue to baffle me.
